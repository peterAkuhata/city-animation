# City Animation

This project was used to demonstrate how to create the parallax effect in an Android app using [Property Animation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation.html).

It was used in a tech demonstration at the [Android Meetup in Wellington, NZ](http://www.meetup.com/Wellington-Android-Development-Meetup/events/219969880/).

The interesting aspects of the project are;

1.	The use of Property Animation to animate a custom Drawable,
2.	The use of a GestureDetector to gradually transform the custom Drawable from the start state to the end state,
3.	The use of [PaintCode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com) to generate the sprite drawing code
4.	Converting C# Xamarin to Android

The Keynote presentation is included in this repo.
